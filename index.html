            <p> Sean is a freelance UX/UI designer based out of Washington, DC.  He is inspired by solving design problems that challenge his skills and knowledge base.  While working as a program coordinator at the American Physical Society, Sean found himself creating small google sites for online conferences coordinated by his department and was invigorated by the creativity site design work afforded him in an administrative heavy environment.  Recognizing a need to develop professional skills Sean began researching UX/UI as a potential next step in his professional career.  During this time one of the projects he was working on initiated a project related website overhaul.  A serendipitous decision to immerse himself in a UX/UI design course shortly after the project website development began a major push to completion, leading to a work/study environment where a concept learned in class led to the concept being applied at work the very next day.</p>
